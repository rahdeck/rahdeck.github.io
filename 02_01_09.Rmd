> How many nonnegative integers less than 1 million contain the digit 2?

The number of all nonnegative integers less than 1 million is $10^6$ because there are ten possible digits at each of the 6 positions). Before you object that this includes numbers like 000010 and 002222 and excludes numbers like 1, 15 or 2098, consider that if we treat a leading 0 as signifying lack of any digit, then it starts to make sense. A number like 000010 is simply 10 and 002222 is 2222, while 2098 is itself. Then we can represent all nonnegative integers below 1 million as having six digits each (from 000000 to 999999) and the calculation makes sense.

We subtract from it the number of all integers that do *NOT* contain 2, which is $9^6$ (nine possible digits (remember, 2 is excluded) at each of the 6 positions) and get:

$$10^6 - 9^6 = `r n <- 10^6 - 9^6; n`$$
