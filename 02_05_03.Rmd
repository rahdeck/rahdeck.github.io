The number of elements in $A$ is 8, so we expect $8^4 = `r n <- 8^4; n`$ sequences.

> (b) Repeat part (a) if no letter is repeated.

$P(8,4) = 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 = `r n <- prod(5:8); n`$.


> (c) Repeat part (a) if the first letter in the sequence is $b$.

Only 3 positions remain so $8^3 = `r n <- 8^3; n`$.


> (d) Repeat part (a) if the first letter is $b$ and the last is $d$ and no letters are
repeated.

There are only 6 remaining elements in $A$ (since $b$ and $d$ are already used) for the 2 remaining positions so $P(6,2) = 6 \cdot 5 = `r n <- 6*5; n`$
