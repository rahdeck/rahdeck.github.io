This is a case of 82-combinations of a 3-set with replacement. The total number of records is:

$$C^{R}(3, 82) = C(84, 82) = C(84,2) = \binom{84}{2} = `r n <- choose(84,2); n`$$

> (b) If overtime losses are not possible?

Calculation is similar to the one above but from only a 2-set:

$$C^{R}(2, 82) = C(83, 82) = C(83,1) = \binom{83}{1} = `r n <- choose(83,1); n`$$
