```

> Calculate the number of different vote totals, using the plurality voting method (see Example 2.25), when there are $m$ candidates and $n$ voters and each voter need not vote.

We will use combinations with replacement here, summing the numbers for $0$ through to $n$ votes:

$$\sum_{i=0}^{n} C^{R}(m, i) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} C(m+i-1, i) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \binom{m+i-1}{i}$$
