There are a total of 8 outcomes (B for boy, G for girl):

1. BBB
1. BBG
1. BGB
1. BGG
1. GBB
1. GBG
1. GGB
1. GGG

Out of these there are 3 outcomes (#2, #3 and #5) that have exactly 2 boys so the probability is $\frac{3}{8}$

> (b) At least 2 boys

It's enough to add one outcome (all boys) to the result in a) to get 4 outcomes with the final probability of $\frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$

> (c) At least 1 boy and at least 1 girl 

We can exclude the 2 outcomes that have only boys (#1) or only girls (#8), for the total of 6 outcomes which gets us the probability of $\frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}$
