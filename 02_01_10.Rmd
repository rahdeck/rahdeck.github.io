> If a function assigns 0 or 1 to each switching function of $n$ variables, how many such functions are there?

There are $2^{2^n}$ switching functions of $n$ variables. For each such function we have two choices (0 or 1) so we need to multiply 2 by itself $2^{2^n}$ times resulting in:

$$2^{2^{2^n}}$$
