> A switching function S is called self-dual if the value S of a bit string is unchanged when 0's and 1's are interchanged. For instance, the function S of Table 2.2 is self-dual, but the function T of that table is not. How many self-dual switching functions of n variables are there?

$$2^{2^{n-1}}$$
