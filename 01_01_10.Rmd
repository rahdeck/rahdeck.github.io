> In Example 1.3, suppose that a computer could analyze as many as 100 billion different pipeline networks in a second, a 100-fold improvement over the speed we assumed in the text. Would this make a significant difference in our conclusions? Why? (Do a computation in giving your answer.)

The original running time in Example 1.3 is given as 190,000,000,000,000,000 years. A mere 100-fold improvement in running speed will still only yield a result after 190,000,000,000,000 years, which doesn't make any meaningful difference.
