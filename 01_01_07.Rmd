> Suppose that we want to build a trinary code for the 26 letters of the alphabet,
using strings in which each symbol is 0, 1, or ; 1.
> (a) Could we encode all 26 letters using strings of length at most 2? Answer this
question by enumeration.

Letter | Code
-------|-----
a      | -1
b      | 0
c      | 1
d      | -1-1
e      | -10
f      | -11
g      | 0-1
h      | 00
i      | 01
j      | 1-1
k      | 10
l      | 11 (the last possible code)
m      | 
n      |
o      |
p      |
q      |
r      |
s      |
t      |
u      |
w      |
v      |
x      |
y      |
z      |

so the answer is **NO**

> (b) What about using strings of length exactly 3?

Letter | Code
-------|-----
a      | -1-1-1
b      | -1-10
c      | -1-11
d      | -10-1
e      | -100
f      | -101
g      | -11-1
h      | -110
i      | -111
j      | 0-1-1
k      | 0-10
l      | 0-11
m      | 00-1
n      | 000
o      | 001
p      | 01-1
q      | 010
r      | 011
s      | 1-1-1
t      | 1-10
u      | 1-11
w      | 10-1
v      | 100
x      | 101
y      | 11-1
z      | 110

so the answer is **YES**
