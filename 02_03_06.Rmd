> (a) How many permutations of $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ have $2$ in the second place?

Fix the $2$ in the second place and permute the remaining 4 elements for the total of $4! = `r n <- factorial(4); n`$ permutations.


>(b) How many permutations of $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$, $n > 3$, have $2$ in the second place and $3$ in the third place?

Fix $2$ in the second place and $3$ in the third place and permute the remaining $n - 2$ elements for the total of $(n - 2)!$ permutations.
