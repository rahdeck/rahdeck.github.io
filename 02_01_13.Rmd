> (Stanat and McAllister [1977]) Every integer can be represented (nonuniquely) in the form $a \times 2^b$ , where $a$ and $b$ are integers. The _floating-point representation_ for an integer uses a bit string of length $p$ to represent an integer by using the first $m$ bits to encode $a$ and the remaining $p - m$ bits to encode $b$, with the latter two encodings performed as described in Exercise 12.

> (a) What is the largest number of distinct integers that can be represented using the floating-point notation for a given $p$?

$$2^m \cdot 2^{2^{p-m}} = 2^{m+2^{p-m}}$$
    

> (b) Repeat part (a) if the floating-point representation is carried out in such a way that the leading bit for encoding the number $a$ is 1.

$$2^{m-1} \cdot 2^{2^{p-m}} = 2^{m+2^{p-m}-1}$$

> (c) Repeat part (a) if 0 must be included.

$$2^{p}-1$
