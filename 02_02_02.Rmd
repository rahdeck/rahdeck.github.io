> A committee is to be chosen from among 8 scientists, 7 psychics, and 12 clerics. If the committee is to have two members of different backgrounds, how many such committees are there?

There can be 3 "types" of commitees:

1. scientist + psychic commitee
1. scientist + cleric commitee
1. psychic + cleric commitee

The scientist + psychic commitee can be created in $8 \cdot 7 = `r n <- 8 * 7; n`$ ways

The scientist + cleric commitee can be created in $8 \cdot 12 = `r n <- 8 * 12; n`$ ways

The psychic +cleric commitee can be created in $7 \cdot 12 = `r n <- 7 * 12; n`$ ways

The number of all possible commitees is the sum of the above:

$$8 \cdot 7 + 8 \cdot 12 + 7 \cdot 12 = `r n <- 8 * 7 + 8*12 + 7 * 12; n`$$
