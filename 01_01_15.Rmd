> Suppose that there are three possible final exam times, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday mornings. Suppose that each instructor of the courses listed in Table 1.10 requests Tuesday morning as a first choice for final exam time. What assignment (assignments) of exam times, if any exist, gives the largest number of instructors their first choice?

Any assignment that includes English and one of Physics or History on Tuesday morning should give two instructors their preferred times.
