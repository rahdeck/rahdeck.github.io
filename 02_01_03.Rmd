```

> (a) Continuing with Exercise 7 of Chapter 1, compute the maximum number of strings of length at most 3 in a trinary code.

$$3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = `r n <- 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3; n`$$

> (b) Repeat for length at most 4.

$$4^1 + 4^2 + 4^3 + 4^4 = `r n <- 4^1 + 4^2 + 4^3 + 4^4; n`$$

> (c) Repeat for length exactly 4, but beginning with a 0 or 1.

$$2 \cdot 4^3 = `r n <- 2 * 4^3; n`$$
