> Each American Express card has a 15-digit number for computer identification purposes. If each digit can be any number between 0 and 9, are there enough different account numbers for 10 million credit-card holders?

`r 10^15 > 10^7` because $10^{15} `r ifelse(10^15 > 10^7, '>', '<')` 10^7$

> Would there be if the digits were only 0 or 1?

`r 2^15 > 10^7` because $2^{15} `r ifelse(2^15 > 10^7, '>', '<')` 10^7$
