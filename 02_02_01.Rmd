> How many bit strings have length 3, 4, or 5?

By the product rule there are:

* $2^3$ bit strings of length 3
* $2^4$ bit strings of length 4
* $2^5$ bit strings of length 5

and by the sum rule we need to add them together to get the final result:

$$2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 = `r n <- 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5; n`$$
