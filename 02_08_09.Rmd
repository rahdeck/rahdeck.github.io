> If a bit string of length 4 is chosen at random, what is the probability of having at least three 1's?

There are a total of $2^4 = `r n <- 2^4; n`$ outcomes and there are $\binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{4} = `r n <- choose(4,3) + choose(4,4); n`$ ways to have a string with at least three 1's in it, so the final probability is $\frac{5}{16}$
