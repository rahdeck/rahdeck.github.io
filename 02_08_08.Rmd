> Suppose that a card is drawn at random from a deck of 52, the card is replaced, and then another card is drawn at random. What is the probability of getting two kings?

Ther probability of getting a king on both tries is $\frac{4}{52}$ (because of the replacement) so the final probability is $\frac{4}{52} \cdot \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{169}$
