> (a) Containing either tomatoes and corn or chocolate and peanuts

There are $2^2$ diets containing tomatoes and corn and also $2^2$ diets containing chocolate and peanuts. They have overlap in one case only, i.e. when the diet contains all four ingredients. The final probability is thus $\frac{2^2 + 2^2 - 1}{2^4} = \frac{`r n <- 2^2 + 2^2 - 1;n`}{`r n <- 2^4; n`}$.

> (b) Containing either tomatoes or all three other foods

There are $2^3$ diets containing tomatoes and $2$ diets containing three other foods. The overlap is a single diet containing tomatoes and the three other foods so the total probability is $\frac{2^3 + 2 - 1}{2^4} = \frac{`r n <- 2^3 + 2 - 1; n`}{`r n <- 2^4; n`}$.
