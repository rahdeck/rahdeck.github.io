There are 6 outcomes in total and 3 of them are an odd number (when 1, 3 or 5 come up) so the probability is $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$

> (b) A number less than or equal to 2

*Please note that my solution differs from the authors' one given at the end*

There are two such outcomes (when 1 or 2 come up) so the probability is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$

> (c) A number divisible by 3

There are 2 such outcomes (when 3 or 6 come up) so the probability is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$

*Authors' answer to b)*: $\frac{1}{36}$[^1]
