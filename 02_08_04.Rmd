> If black hair, brown hair, and blond hair are equally likely (and no other hair colors can occur), what is the probability that a family of 3 children has at least two blondes?

There are a total of $3^3 = `r n <- 3**3; n`$ outcomes (by the multiplication rule: there are 3 colors for 3 children). There are $\binom{3}{2} \cdot 2 = `r n <- choose(3,2) * 2; n`$ ways to have exactly 2 blondes and we need to add one more way (all blondes) to the final result to get $\frac{\binom{3}{2} \cdot 2 + 1}{3^3} = \frac{`r n <- choose(3, 2) * 2 + 1; n`}{`r n <- 3^3; n`}$
