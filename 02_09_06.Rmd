> Suppose that a codeword of length 8 consists of letters $A$, $B$, or $C$ or digits $0$ or $1$, and cannot start with $1$. How many such codewords are there?

There are 4 choices for the first position (we're excluding $1$) and $5^7 = `r n <- 5^7; n`$ choices for the subsequent positions for the total of:

$$4 \cdot 5^7 = `r n <- 4 * 5^7; n`$$
